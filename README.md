# EngineeringFinalCamera
1. Project Title
How is your project/application called?
PanoLapse for its dual functionality of Panoramas and Timelapses
2. Team
Who worked on this project/application?
Calvin Mack
Roscow Welsh
Braden Parks

3. Project Objective
Describe what you set out to achieve. What micro:bit capabilities were necessary and/or useful for your implementation.
We set out to achieve a useful tool in which a typical camera user can use as a assistant. The micro:bit was used primarly with its compass and internal timer that allowed for us to actually pull off the panorama(compass) and the time lapse(timer).

4. Research
What sources did you consult (Web, instructor, etc)? Don't plagiarize; give credit where it's due!

5. Design
Describe your design briefly and reference any supporting materials in the assets folder. Talk about input, output, processing, and storage (aka memory) in your design. 
Most of the code is seeded While loops that helped keep it all seperate and orginzed this does cause the problem of not being able to back up but it works quite well input is just the buttons A and B, Output consists of both the LEDs on the 5x5 screen and a small pulse that makes the camera take the picture 
Calvin also created a sleave to attach the micro:bit and prevent the camera from shorting it out as well as keep it attached for easier use while on the camera and prevents any dangling of the micro:bit


6. Development
Keep a list of your development activities here, regardless of their success. Reference any supporting materials or external sources.
Inital testing was each person going off into their own goal Roscow is timelapse, Calvin with panorama, Braden with the menu system these went well but required alot of planning Braden had a hard time teorizing the menu system and overall where to start the intial menus had alot of conflicting errors between the two systems

7. Testing
Describe your testing approach. What was successful and what failed?
Theorizing ideas on a white board helpped alot when we would come together and then split off again I think it helped us just formulate ideas and come up with new ways to think about it
Tinkering and trial and error were also great ways to think about things diffrently Braden had alot of tinkering going on and constantly had to scrap code and other things


8. Demo
Briefly report on the results of the in-class demo.
Calvin made a presitation and tried to go into detail about it with the hardware we then awnsered questions based on it and the demo itself went really well we got it working and were able to show off the basics of it funtionality

9. Summary
Summarize your project, from idea to demo. Point out lessons learned. Mention the most important features of the micro:bit that supported your application.
